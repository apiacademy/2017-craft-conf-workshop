# Hypermedia Hacking Workshop (2017)

## Stuff to Bring

To get the full experience, you should bring the following hardware/software/supplies to the workshop.  You can learn from the session even if you just show up w/ paper and pencil, but you'll get most out of it if you come ready to write and run your own code and the supplied examples.

### Your own machine
The best-case scenario is to arrive with the following already up and running on your machine. You can try to install NodeJS, git, and/or an editor when you arrive, but assume the Internet connections at the session will be minimal. 

You MAY be able to handle all these requirements via an SSH connection to your own machine `back home' but, again, assume the Internet connections at the session will be minimal.

 * Laptop running your favorite OS
 * NodeJs installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 * git client installed (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 * your favorite code/text editor


### Services/Accounts 
All the code examples will be posted on github. All the running services will be hosted at Heroku. If you want to be able to commit to github, you'll need a github account. If you want to be able to commit to Herkou, you'll need an account there, too. Both offer free account levels that will work just fine for the workshop.
