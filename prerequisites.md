# Hypermedia Hacking Workshop (2017)

## Prerequisites

You can get a head start on the workshop by checking out the following print and video materials. These area not *required*, but will get you "in the zone" for talking and thinking in hypermedia terms.

### Books
Check out one or more of these books. You can just skim the contents to get the feel of the kind of things we'll be talking about in the workshop. Reading in depth will help you gain skills useful during the sessions, too.

 * "RESTful Web Clients" (Amundsen)
 * "RESTful Web APIs" (Richardson)
 * "Building Hypermedia APIs with Node and HTML5" (Amundsen)

### Videos
These are sessions I've done in the past on similar topics. Again, skipping through to get the highlights will help you prep for the workshop. Watching the full-length vids (maybe on high speed?) will give you more detail to lean on during the sessions.

 * "REST Hypermedia, and the Semantic Gap" (http://g.mamund.com/rest-gap)
 * "From Zero to Hypermedia in 30 minutes" (http://g.mamund.com/zero-to-hyper)
 * "Learning Client Hypermedia from the Ground Up" (http://g.mamund.com/hyper-up)
